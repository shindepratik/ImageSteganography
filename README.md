# ImageSteganography

Steganography is a process of encrypting confidential data files into host files, and transmitting the obtained encrypted files from the sender to the receiver. Although people have employed the technique of hiding secret messages in plain sight using various techniques throughout ages, the recent surge in computer usage and technological advances has propelled the need for security and confidentiality to the forefront.

Keeping this in mind, I developed a steganographic application, as part of my final year project.

After download, you can directly execute the .exe file on your system, and when prompted for a password, just enter 'pratik'.

Note: This application was created long ago, and I have not committed to it for nearly a year.
